Installing GigaDB
-----------------

GigaDB can be automatically installed in a virtual machine (VM) using
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) and [Chef Solo](https://docs.chef.io/chef_solo.html).

Vagrant provides a command line utility for creating VMs. To get
started, download and install Vagrant using the appropriate installer
 or package for your platform which is available from the
[Vagrant download page](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).
There is no need to install any software for Chef-Solo since Vagrant
will automatically do this for you.

The next step is to download the GigaDB code base which is available
from [GitHub](https://github.com/gigascience/gigadb-website).
