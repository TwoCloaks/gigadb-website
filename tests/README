* How to install:

On Mac, using homebrew:

brew install phantomjs
brew install casperjs


(Alternatively, both can be installed with npm)

* To run the tests:

casperjs test tests/admin-dataset-form-loading.js

casperjs test tests/admin-dataset-keywords.js

casperjs test tests/submission-wizard-test.js


("casperjs test tests" doesn't work quite yet, need to refactor the test and create a proper setup function for them)
